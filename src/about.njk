<!-- Main About Content -->
<section class="section-padding bg-bg-section relative">
    <div class="container relative z-10">
        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
            <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black mb-8 text-text-primary leading-tight">Websites built with purpose and care</h2>
            
            <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                <p>My name is Carl, and I'm the founder of CodeCraft North. I've been building websites for about fifteen years, working with everything from small local firms to national brands. Before launching CodeCraft North, I spent time as a Web Development Project Manager at one of the UK's largest digital agencies — and that experience completely changed how I viewed the industry.</p>
                
                <p>Large agencies often do impressive work, but their structure and pricing leave many small businesses behind. Projects move between teams, costs escalate, and clients are expected to stay deeply involved at every step. Most business owners simply don't have the time — or the technical background — to manage that kind of process. They need someone they can trust to handle it properly.</p>
                
                <p>Today, alongside running CodeCraft North, I work as a Web Developer for one of the UK's leading occupational health providers. That role keeps me close to enterprise-level systems and best practices in performance, security, and accessibility — standards I bring to every site I build for small businesses.</p>
                
                <p>I started CodeCraft North to remove the noise and make professional websites accessible again. No inflated agency fees, no endless forms, no jargon. Just clean, fast, modern websites built properly from the ground up, with hosting, updates, and support included.</p>
                
                <p class="font-semibold text-text-primary">But here's the truth: you're not just paying for a website — you're investing in a developer who stays involved.</p>
                
                <p>A website alone won't bring customers or grow your business if it's left untouched. My job is to help you use it as a genuine growth tool: reviewing performance, refining content, improving SEO, and making sure your site keeps working for you long after launch.</p>
                
                <p>Every site is designed to perform — lightweight code for speed, strong on-page SEO, and a structure that supports real business growth. Through my managed subscription plans, I stay involved long after launch, handling updates and offering plain-English advice that helps your website pull its weight for your business.</p>
                
                <p>CodeCraft North isn't a big agency, and that's intentional. It's a personal, hands-on service built on experience, trust, and craftsmanship. If you want a website that looks good, performs well, and actually helps your business grow, that's exactly what I build.</p>

<!-- Why Not In-House Section -->

            <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black mb-8 text-text-primary leading-tight">Why not hire an in-house developer?</h2>
            
            <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                <p>Many business owners consider hiring a web developer full-time, but it's rarely the most efficient option. A skilled developer can cost £35,000–£50,000 per year once salary, pension, equipment, and management time are factored in — and that's before training, software, and hosting costs.</p>
                
                <p>For most small businesses, that's overkill. You don't need a full-time developer sitting idle between updates — you need reliable expertise on tap when you need it. That's exactly what CodeCraft North provides: professional-level development, ongoing maintenance, and proactive improvements for a fraction of the cost of hiring internally.</p>
                
                <p class="font-semibold text-text-primary text-xl">It's like having your own web department, without the overhead.</p>
