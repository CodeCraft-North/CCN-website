When it comes to getting a professional website, you generally have two options: a subscription-based managed service or a one-off build. Both have their place, but which is right for your business?

## The subscription model

With a subscription service (like our Essentials and Growth plans), you pay a monthly fee that covers:

- Initial website build
- Hosting and security
- Regular backups
- Ongoing maintenance and updates
- Technical support
- Content changes and small edits

### Advantages of subscriptions

**Lower upfront cost**: Instead of paying thousands upfront, you spread the cost over monthly payments that fit your budget.

**Ongoing support**: Your website isn't "done" — it evolves with your business. Need to update your services? Change a price? Add a new page? It's all included.

**Peace of mind**: No worrying about hosting, backups, security updates, or technical issues. We handle everything.

**Predictable costs**: You know exactly what you're paying each month, making budgeting straightforward.

**Professional partnership**: You have a developer who knows your site inside-out and is invested in your success.

### When subscriptions work best

Subscription plans are ideal if you:

- Want ongoing support and don't want to manage technical aspects yourself
- Prefer predictable monthly costs over large upfront payments
- Need regular content updates or additions
- Value having a responsive partner rather than handling everything yourself
- Run a growing business that will need website changes over time

## The one-off build

A one-off project means paying a single fee for a complete website that you then own outright. You're responsible for hosting, maintenance, and future changes.

### Advantages of one-off builds

**Full ownership**: The site is yours to host wherever you choose and modify as you see fit.

**No recurring fees**: After the initial payment, your only ongoing costs are hosting and domain registration (typically £50-150/year).

**Complete control**: You can switch developers, change hosts, or manage everything in-house.

**Better for technical teams**: If you have in-house developers or prefer handling everything yourself, ownership makes sense.

### When one-off builds work best

One-off projects are ideal if you:

- Have a larger upfront budget available
- Have technical skills or staff who can handle updates and maintenance
- Want full control and ownership from day one
- Have a very stable business that won't need frequent website changes
- Prefer to manage your own hosting and technical infrastructure

## The hybrid approach

At CodeCraft North, we also offer one-off static builds with optional hosting. You get:

- A fast, secure static website built to your specs
- The option to host with us or take it elsewhere
- Optional ongoing support on an ad-hoc basis

This gives you more flexibility than a subscription without the full responsibility of managing everything yourself.

## Making the decision

Ask yourself:

1. **Budget**: Can you afford a larger upfront payment, or would monthly payments work better?
2. **Technical ability**: Are you comfortable managing hosting, backups, and updates yourself?
3. **Time**: Do you have time to handle website issues, or would you rather focus on your business?
4. **Growth**: Will your business need regular website changes and additions?
5. **Support**: Do you value having a responsive partner who knows your site?

## The honest truth

For most small businesses, a subscription makes more sense. You get professional support, predictable costs, and a partner invested in your success — all without the technical headaches.

But if you have the budget, technical skills, and prefer full ownership, a one-off build can work well.
