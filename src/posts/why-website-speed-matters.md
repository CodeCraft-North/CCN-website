Your website's loading speed isn't just a technical metric — it's a business metric. Every second counts when it comes to keeping visitors engaged and converting them into customers.

## The real cost of a slow website

Studies consistently show that visitors abandon websites that take more than 3 seconds to load. For small businesses, this means:

- **Lost revenue**: Slow load times directly impact your bottom line
- **Poor user experience**: Frustrated visitors don't become customers
- **Lower search rankings**: Google penalises slow websites in search results
- **Damaged credibility**: A sluggish site suggests an unreliable business

## What slows websites down?

The most common culprits for small business websites include:

1. **Oversized images**: High-resolution photos that haven't been optimized
2. **Bloated page builders**: WordPress themes packed with features you don't use
3. **Too many plugins**: Each plugin adds weight and potential conflicts
4. **Poor hosting**: Budget shared hosting with hundreds of sites on one server
5. **Unoptimized code**: Messy, inefficient code that takes longer to process

## How to speed up your website

The good news? Most speed issues are fixable:

### Quick wins

- **Compress images**: Use tools like TinyPNG or WebP format
- **Enable caching**: Store static versions of your pages
- **Use a CDN**: Serve content from servers closer to your visitors
- **Minimize plugins**: Remove anything you don't actively need

### Long-term solutions

- **Choose lightweight themes**: Or better yet, use a static site generator
- **Upgrade hosting**: Invest in quality hosting that can handle your traffic
- **Implement lazy loading**: Load images only when they're about to appear on screen
- **Regular maintenance**: Keep your CMS, themes, and plugins updated

## The static site advantage

One of the most effective ways to guarantee fast load times is to use a static site generator like Eleventy. Static sites:

- Load almost instantly (often under 1 second)
- Can't be slowed down by database queries
- Are inherently more secure
- Cost less to host

That's why we build many of our client sites using static generators — they're fast, secure, and reliable.
