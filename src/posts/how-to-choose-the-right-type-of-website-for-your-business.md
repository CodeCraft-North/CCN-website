# How to Choose the Right Type of Website for Small Business

If you are trying to work out the right **type of website for small business**, you are not overthinking it. This decision genuinely matters.

Most UK business owners are told they “need a website” but nobody explains what that website is supposed to *do*. So they pay for something that looks decent, but does not move the needle.

Not all websites serve the same purpose. A brochure site, a lead generation site, and an ecommerce site are built for completely different outcomes. If you choose the wrong model, you can easily invest money and still feel frustrated six months later.

Let’s break this down properly.


## The Three Core Small Business Website Types

When people talk about **small business website types**, they are usually referring to three main models. Everything else is just a variation of these.

- Brochure website
- Lead generation website
- Ecommerce website

That is it.

The mistake I see repeatedly is this. A business wants regular enquiries but builds a brochure site. Or a business only needs credibility but ends up paying for ecommerce features it will never use.

Before you think about design, branding, or tech, you need clarity on the job your website is doing.

## Brochure Website vs Lead Generation Website

This is where most confusion sits. A **brochure website vs lead generation website** can look similar on the surface. Both may have five or six pages, some service descriptions, and a contact form.

The difference is not visual. It is strategic.

### What a Brochure Website Is Actually For

A brochure website exists to support your reputation. It is there to reassure people who have already heard of you.

It works particularly well if:

- You rely heavily on referrals
- You operate locally
- Most customers already know roughly what you do
- Your sales happen through conversation

A brochure site’s job is simple. It proves you are legitimate, professional, and easy to contact.

For many UK trades, consultants, and local service businesses, this is exactly the right type of website for small business growth.

Typical UK pricing for a straightforward brochure build:

- £800 to £2,000 one off
- £20 to £50 per month for hosting and support

If you are paying significantly more than that for a basic five page site with no strategy behind it, ask what value is actually being added.

Our [Static Essentials Site](/services/essentials-website-subscription/) follows this model. It focuses on speed, clarity, and long term reliability, not unnecessary complexity.

### What a Lead Generation Website Is Designed To Do

A lead generation website is built to create enquiries, not just display information.

This model is structured around:

- Clear positioning
- Specific target audiences
- Strong problem and solution messaging
- Clear and repeated calls to action

It often includes dedicated service pages and sometimes location specific pages if local SEO is part of the strategy.

If you are comparing brochure website vs lead generation website, the real question is this:

Do you want your website to support your business, or actively grow it?

There is no shame in either answer. But you need to be honest about which one you want.

Lead generation sites typically cost more because they require more thinking, research, and content planning.

In the UK, expect:

- £1,500 to £3,500 for a proper strategic build
- Ongoing SEO or content work if you want consistent traffic

If someone promises “page one in 30 days” without discussing competition or demand, be cautious. For balanced guidance, the UK Government’s advice on improving your online presence is a sensible starting point:

If you prefer steady improvement rather than a one off build, our [Growth Website Subscription](/services/growth-website-subscription/) is built around ongoing optimisation rather than launch and disappear.

## When Ecommerce Is the Right Type of Website for Small Business

Ecommerce is often chosen because it feels modern. That does not automatically make it right.

An ecommerce website makes sense when:

- You sell physical products
- You sell digital products
- You want automated checkout and payment
- You ship beyond your immediate local area

It does not make sense if your service is bespoke, high value, and requires discussion before sale.

Ecommerce sites are more complex by nature. They need secure payment gateways, product management systems, stock handling, and ongoing maintenance.

Typical UK pricing:

- £2,500 to £8,000 depending on scale
- £30 to £100 per month for hosting, security, and support

If you are quoted £999 for unlimited products, lifetime support, and advanced features, it is worth asking how that is sustainable.


## How to Decide the Right Type of Website for Small Business Growth

Here is the simplest way to choose.

Ask yourself one question:

What must this website achieve in the next 12 months?

If the answer is credibility and professionalism, a brochure website is enough.

If the answer is steady new enquiries, a lead generation website is more appropriate.

If the answer is automated online sales, ecommerce is the right route.

The right **type of website for small business** depends entirely on your business model, not on trends.


## Common Mistakes UK Businesses Make

There are predictable patterns I see over and over.

- Building before defining the target customer
- Copying competitors without understanding their positioning
- Overcomplicating the technology stack
- Ignoring mobile performance
- Prioritising design over clarity

Your website is not an art project. It is a commercial tool.

Most frustration does not come from bad design. It comes from unclear expectations.


## Final Thoughts

Choosing between small business website types does not need to be overwhelming.

Brochure sites build trust.
Lead generation sites drive enquiries.
Ecommerce sites automate sales.

They are different tools for different jobs.

If you feel confused, that is normal. The industry often talks about features instead of outcomes. Focus on the outcome first. Once you know what your website needs to do, the structure becomes obvious.

And once the structure is right, everything else becomes much simpler.
