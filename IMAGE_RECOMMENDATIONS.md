# Code Craft North - Image Recommendations

## 🎨 **Visual Enhancement Strategy**

Your website now has beautiful CSS graphics and animations, but adding strategic images will make it even more compelling. Here are my recommendations:

## 📸 **Recommended Image Sources**

### **Free Stock Photo Sites:**
1. **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) - High-quality, professional photos
2. **Pexels** (pexels.com) - Great for business and tech imagery
3. **Pixabay** (pixabay.com) - Large selection of web design photos
4. **Freepik** (freepik.com) - Vectors and illustrations (free with attribution)

### **Premium Options:**
1. **Shutterstock** - Professional business imagery
2. **Getty Images** - High-end commercial photos
3. **Adobe Stock** - Integrated with Creative Suite

## 🖼️ **Specific Image Recommendations**

### **Hero Section Background (Optional)**
- **Size:** 1920x1080px or larger
- **Style:** Clean, modern office or tech workspace
- **Keywords to search:** "modern office", "web development", "clean workspace", "UK business"
- **Alternative:** Keep current CSS gradient (looks great!)

### **About Section - Carl's Photo**
- **Size:** 400x400px (square)
- **Style:** Professional headshot, friendly and approachable
- **Background:** Neutral or your brand colours
- **Placement:** Next to the quote section

### **Process/How We Work Section**
- **Size:** 800x600px
- **Style:** Team collaboration, planning, or development process
- **Keywords:** "team meeting", "web development process", "planning session"

### **Services/Features Section**
- **Size:** 600x400px each
- **Style:** Icons or illustrations representing each service
- **Current:** SVG icons work perfectly (already implemented!)

## 🎯 **Image Style Guidelines**

### **Visual Style:**
- Clean, modern, and professional
- Consistent colour palette (your brand colours)
- High contrast and sharp focus
- Avoid overly corporate or stock-photo-looking images

### **Technical Requirements:**
- **Format:** WebP (preferred) or JPEG
- **Optimisation:** Compress for web (use TinyPNG or similar)
- **Responsive:** Include srcset for different screen sizes
- **Alt text:** Descriptive for accessibility

## 🚀 **Quick Implementation Options**

### **Option 1: Keep Current Design (Recommended)**
Your current CSS-only design looks fantastic and professional. The gradients, animations, and SVG icons create a modern, cohesive look.

### **Option 2: Add Strategic Images**
If you want to add images, I recommend:
1. A professional headshot for the about section
2. A subtle background pattern or texture
3. Maybe one hero image (but current gradient is excellent)

### **Option 3: Custom Illustrations**
Consider commissioning custom illustrations that match your brand perfectly.

## 💡 **My Recommendation**

**Keep the current design!** Your website already looks professional and modern with:
- Beautiful CSS gradients and animations
- Clean SVG icons
- Professional typography
- Excellent visual hierarchy

The CSS-only approach is actually a strength - it's fast, accessible, and perfectly branded. Adding images should be strategic and enhance rather than distract from your excellent design.

## 🔧 **If You Want to Add Images**

I can help you:
1. Add image placeholders to the HTML
2. Implement responsive image loading
3. Optimise images for performance
4. Add lazy loading for better speed

Just let me know what specific images you'd like to add and I'll implement them properly!
